# JSRaytracer
The source code for my Javascript raytracer that can render images in real time in your browser. The website can be found at https://alex-panda.github.io/

## Website Generation
I am using Jinja2 and python to generate the website. Because of how GitHub pages works, all the webpages must be flat HTML pages, so I use the generate.py file in the src folder to generate the HTML pages and put them at the top level of the repository (the level that this README.md is at).
