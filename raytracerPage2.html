        After following chapters 7-12 of "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter
        Shirley, I have made various improvements to the raytracer. For starters,
        I added antialiasing and basic diffusion in chapters 7 and 8, I then added
        more diffusion through the addition of metal materials and refractive glass
        materials in chapter 9 and 10, as well as a positionable and more configurable
        camera in chapters 11 and 12.
    </p>

    <p>
        The antialiasing I added in chapter 7 makes curves appear more smooth and
        edges appear more straight. This is because, without antialiasing, there
        is only 1 ray of light emitted per pixel, thus making each pixel starkly
        1 color. If that pixel appears next to another pixel of a different
        color, as happens when the pixel is on the edge of a green-colored
        object with a blue background pixel over the edge of the object, you see
        starkly the contrast between the green pixel and the blue pixel (you see
        the line created where the green pixel ends and the blue pixel begins).
        With antialiasing, however, you send 100 (or some arbitrary other
        number) of rays through the pixel, each one slightly off from the center
        of the pixel, and then average the colors of the rays. This way some of
        the rays will hit the edge and others will miss it, thus some will
        return green and some will return blue. As you then average the colors
        of the rays, you will make this edge pixel a nice transition pixel
        between the green pixels of the object and the blue pixels of the
        background, reducing the outline of each pixel and enhancing the outline
        of the shape. Antialiasing can be seen in the render below at edges of
        each shape as the edge pixel transitions between the color of the object
        the color of whatever is on the other side of the edge of the object.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I added diffusion in chapters 8-10, I added materials to the
        objects so that they could have different properties and thus affect the
        light differently when hit. Diffusion allows materials
        to scatter almost no light, a bit of light, or almost all light that hits them.
        This is the difference between the matte grey, brown, and blue spheres below and
        the reflective metal and gold spheres in the middle render below.
        Materials can also scatter light in different ways. Some scatter light by reflecting
        it (like the metal spheres below) and others refract light (like the glass sphere
        below) by allowing the light ray to pass through the object, but bending it as it
        does so.

        The camera improvements made in chapters 11 and 12 allow the user change
        the camera's positon, focal point, orientation, aperature, focus
        distance, field of view, and change what the point in the cenery the
        camera is looking at. All of these added features allow the user of the
        ray-tracer to use the camera like a proper photographer and take more
        interesting pictures of the scenery, but only a simple demonstration of
        this is shown below.

        <li>My Goals</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Change the website so that it uses an html generator to generate the html pages more easily.</li>
            <li>Finish chapters 7-12 of the textbook and update the website to reflect the new changes to the raytracer.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>My Results</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned python Jinja and used it for html generation of my website.</li>
